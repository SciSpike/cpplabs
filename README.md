Introduction
------------

This repository contains various exercises and solutions for SciSpike's C++ Advanced C++ course.

Instructions
------------

Each exercise has some starting directory and a solutions directory.

The starting directory ends with _Ex_ and the soluctions can be found in directories ending with _Sol_. E.g.:

* Say we have an exercise called _LambdaExpressions_
  * The exercise directory (starting point) is be named _LambdaExpressionsEx_
  * The soluciton directory is be named _LamdaExpressionsSol_

You may want to first try to complete the exercise without peeking at the solution, but if you need some hint or help, feel free to peek at the solutions. 
This is an advanced course and some of the exercises are tricky, so don't feel embarrassed by having to peek :) 

Let the instructor know if you find errors in the exercise or have suggestions for how we can improve the exercises.
