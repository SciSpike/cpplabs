Exercise Description:
=====================

This exercise explores C++ namespaces by swapping vendors of a ‘string’ class. You begin with Person and Company classes that currently use the standard string through explicit qualification (std::string).

1. Continue to use the standard string, but replace all explicit qualification, with either the using directive or the using declaration. Compile and make sure it works.

2. Swap string vendors from the STL, to InferData. InferData’s string (and namespace declaration) is in the file “idstring.h”. Compile and make sure it works with the InferData string.
