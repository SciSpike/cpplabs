Exercise Description:
=====================

A common approach for testing C++ classes is to create a parallel hierarchy of test classes. The test classes are often defined as friends of the “real” class to enable direct access to the private implementation. 

In this exercise we will create two test classes; one for Person and one for Company.

* Implement a PersonTest class and a CompanyTest class
* Implement a test function for each class
