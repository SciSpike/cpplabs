Exercise Description:
=====================

Create an instance of a Rectangle and assign it to a pointer to Shape.

Try to take a pointer to Shape and assign it to a pointer to Rectangle. The compiler will not let us do that, so we will force it.

The program will work fine because we really know that we are doing the right thing.

Now do the same, but use casting to assign a pointer to Document to a pointer to Shape
Invoke an operation on a “shape” and watch the system crash.

Note: 
    Use the original C-style cast for this exercise
