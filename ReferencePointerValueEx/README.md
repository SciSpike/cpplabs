In the exercise you are to implement a hire function on a class called Company

The hire function should add the person to a list of employees

Decide how to pass the person to the hire function:

* void Company::hire( Person p )?
* void Company::hire( Person *p )?
* void Company::hire( Person &p )?

Check the other interfaces also. Should other parameters (to Person or Company) be changed to use pointers, references or values?
