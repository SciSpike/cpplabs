Exercise Description
====================

Before we begin using the STL, it is useful to study what it is the library will be doing and handling for us. Try the following exercise without using any of the STL classes.

Design an application to read an arbitrarily large text file and output a sorted list of the unique "words" that occur in the file. i.e., write an application that reads an unknown number of whitespace-delimited text strings, sorts them, and prints out the unique elements. Ignore parsing issues by accepting anything cin returns as a single word ("cin >> s", where s is declared as an array of chars or a pointer to a char).

Before you start: Estimate how long it would take to write this app? How many lines of code would it take? What are the key classes?
