Exercise Description
====================

For the class Shape, define a static member which keeps track of how many instances were created.

Do the same for the subclasses.

After creating a couple of instances, call static member functions to report the number of created instances

How could we get the report on created instances without ‘hardcoding’ the calls of the static member?
