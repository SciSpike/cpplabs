Exercise Description
====================

Complete the “Address Book” application using the associative containers described in this chapter.

“Address Book” is a menu-driven application that maintains a list of people and their phone numbers. The application repeatedly prompts the user with the following options:

* Add a new entry
* Delete an entry
* Find an entry
* List all entries
* Quit

Feel free to declare your internal list globally, or as a static variable inside the “handleInput()” function.
