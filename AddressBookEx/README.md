Exercise Description
====================

Complete the “Address Book” application using the associative containers described in this chapter.

“Address Book” is a menu-driven application that maintains a list of people and their phone numbers. The application repeatedly prompts the user with the following options:

* Add a new entry
* Delete an entry

* Quit

You may delcare your map in static space (not recommened style) or you can simply define the map as a static variable inside the handleInput() function.
