Overview
========

In this lab we'll illustrate the recommended separation of interface and implementation.

First, we want to make sure that you have a Shape class that defines an interface (only).

Second, we'll extract the commonality between concrete Shapes (such as Rectangles and Ovals) in a common implementation class we'll call ShapeImplementation.

Finally, demonstrate the use of the initialization list.
